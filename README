This is the port of ANTLR StringTemplate engine 3.2.1 by Terence Parr into PHP. 
The best way to check what is working is to run the unit tests.

>php test.php

Library requires the following frameworks:

* PHPUnit 3.4
* Zend Framework 1.10
* Antlr PHP Runtime 3.2

and above.

To generate grammar - get the latest Antlr runtime implementation for PHP.
It must contain an antlr-tool launching script, which you can invoke as 

../antlr-php-runtime/antlr-tool.sh src/php/Antlr/StringTemplate/Language/Group.g

an so on.

You must also extend your PHP include path with 'Antlr/Runtime/..' code 
in order to use StringTemplate.
